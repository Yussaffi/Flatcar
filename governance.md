# Overview


Flatcar is a community based project, anyone who wants to participate is welcomed. We adopted the [Microsoft Open Source code of Conduct](https://microsoft.github.io/codeofconduct/) as we pledge to be an opening and welcoming community for anyone who want to participate in it.

The project is governed by a flat hierarchy - a group of people sharing a common vision of Flatcar in accordance to its mission statement.

### Maintainers

Flatcar maintainers are members of the Flatcar community with commit access to one or more repositories of the project.
Maintainers are active community members who are responsible for the overall quality and stewardship of the project, and are expected to remain actively involved in the project and participate in voting and discussing of proposed project level changes.

Anyone with an established track record of contributions to the project can become a maintainer.
The contributions are expected to be substantial, and must demonstrate a commitment to the long-term success of the project.
Maintainership is not limited to engineering / development merits; all contributions - e.g. working with issues, providing guidance and feedback to users, reviewing PRs, contributing to docs, evangelising Flatcar - count.
Becoming a maintainer is about building trust with the current maintainers of the project and being a person that they can depend on to make decisions in the best interest of the project in a consistent manner.

Maintainer candidates should have demonstrated they:
- Collaborate well.
- Have a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Flatcar code base, technical goals, and directions.
- Actively engage with major Flatcar feature proposals and implementations.

Periodically, the existing maintainers curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months.
The nominating maintainer will create a PR to update the Maintainers List.
It is recommended to describe the reasons for the nomination and the contribution of the nominee in the PR.
Upon consensus of incumbent maintainers, the PR will be approved and the new maintainer becomes active.


### Retirement

Life priorities, interests, and passions can change.
If you're a maintainer but feel you must remove yourself from the list, inform other maintainers that you intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work. 
At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.

After you've informed other maintainers, create a pull request to remove yourself from the MAINTAINERS file.
